EFScreenPlay
============

EFScreenPlay is a set of utility classes/categories/etc for dealing with modular storyboards and hooking up storyboards into a 'screen play'.

Storyboards in Xcode are a great way to structure layouts. In sufficiently large applications however it quickly becomes problematic to work in a single story board file (especially when working on an app with a team of developers).

Fortunately it's perfectly possible to create modular storyboards. Unfortunately hooking them up together and navigating between storyboards can be a bit cumbersome. Therefor we created a set of utility methods to make it slightly easier to navigate from one storyboard to the next.

When working with Storyboards, we've found this article to be a good set of best practices: http://robsprogramknowledge.blogspot.com/2012/01/uistoryboard-best-practices.html
